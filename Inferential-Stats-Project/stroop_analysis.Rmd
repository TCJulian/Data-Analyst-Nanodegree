### Independent and Dependent variables

The __independent variable__ for this experiment would be the the conditions of the words. They change from congruent to incongruent between the two trials.

The __dependent variable__ would the the amount of time it takes a participant to complete the test. This is measured in seconds. 

### Hypothesis and Statistical Test

The hypothesis can be pictured as:

\begin{align}
H_0 : £g = £g_i \\
H_a : £g ¡Ú £g_i
\end{align}

The statistical test that will be used is a two-tailed t-test. This t-test is chosen because the population parameters are unknown. It is two-tailed because we are unsure whether the times will rise or fall between word conditions.
